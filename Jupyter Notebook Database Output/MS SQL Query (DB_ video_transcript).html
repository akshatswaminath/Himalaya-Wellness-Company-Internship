Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck,
which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time
craning over garden fences spying on the neighbours.
The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley,
and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret,
and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years.
In fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister,
because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband
were as un-Dursleyish as it was possible to be.
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say
if the Potters arrived in the street.
The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son too,
but they had never even seen him.
This boy was another good reason for keeping

They didn't want Dudley mixing,
with a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull grey Tuesday our story starts,
there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside
to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country.
Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work,
and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily
as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half-past eight,
Mr. Dursley said,
Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase,
pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek,
and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye,
but missed,
because Dudley was now having a tantrum
and throwing his cereal at the walls.
Little tyke,
chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house.
He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed
the first sign of something peculiar,
a cat reading a map.
For a second,

and then he jerked his head around to look again.
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive,
but there wasn't a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of?
It must have been a trick of the light.
Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.
It stared back.
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road,
he watched the cat in his mirror.
It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive.
No, no, looking at the sign.
Cats couldn't read it.
Cats couldn't read maps or signs.
Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake
and put the cat out of his mind.
As he drove towards town,
he thought of nothing except a large order of drills
he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of the town,
drills were driven out of his mind by something else.
As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam,
he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be
a lot of strangely dressed people about,
people in cloaks.
Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people
who dressed

              POSITIVE/NEGATIVE SENTIMENT:
              Positive sentiment: The passage mentions things that Mr. Dursley wants or finds interesting, such as drills and cloaks. It also highlights his curiosity and attention to detail.
Negative sentiment: The passage also mentions things that Mr. Dursley finds annoying or bothersome, such as people who dress strangely. It could be inferred that he has a negative attitude towards these individuals.

He supposed this was some stupid new fashion.
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel
and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos
standing quite close by.
They were whispering excitedly together.
Mr. Dursley was enraged to see
that a couple of them weren't young at all.
Why, that man had to be older than he was
and wearing an emerald green cloak?
The nerve of him.
But then it struck Mr. Dursley
that this was probably some silly stunt.
These people were obviously collecting for something.
Yes, that would be it.
The traffic moved on,
and a few minutes later,
Mr. Dursley arrived at the Grunnings parking lot,
his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window
in his office on the ninth floor.
If he hadn't, he might have found it harder
to concentrate on drills that morning.
He didn't see the owls swooping,
passing past in broad daylight.
Though people down in the street did,
they pointed and gazed, ope

as owl after owl sped overhead.
Most of them had never seen an owl,
even at night-time.
Mr. Dursley, however,
had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.
He yelled at five different people,
he made several important telephone calls
and shouted a bit more.
He was in a very good mood until lunch-time,
when he thought he'd stretch his legs
and walk across the road
to buy himself a drink.
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks
until he passed a group of them next to the bakers.
He eyed them angrily as he passed.
He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy.
This bunch were whispering excitedly, too,
and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.
It was on his way back past them,
clutching a large doughnut in a bag,
that he caught a few words of what they were saying.
The potters, that's right, that's what I heard.
Yes, their son, Harry.
Harry?
Mr Dursley stopped dead.
Fear flooded him.
He looked back at the whisperers
as if he wanted to say something to them,
but thought bett

SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL

The text describes a series of events that occur in the morning, including Mr. Dursley's normal activities and his unease around people in cloaks. The text also mentions Harry Potter, but does not provide any information about him. The overall sentiment of the text is neutral as it does not convey any strong emotions or opinions.

He dashed back across the road,
hurried up to his office,
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him,
seized his telephone,
and had almost finished dialling his home number
when he changed his mind.
He put the receiver back down
and stroked his moustache, thinking.
No, he was being stupid.
Potter wasn't such an unusual name.
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter,
who had a son called Harry.
Come to think of it,
he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry.
He'd never even seen the boy.
It might have been Harvey or Harold.
There was no point in worrying Mrs Dursley.
She always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
He didn't blame her, if he'd had a sister like that.
But all the same, those people in cloaks.
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon,
and when he left the building at five o'clock,
he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone
just outside the door.
Sorry, he grunted,

It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised
that the man was wearing a violet cloak.
He didn't seem at all upset
at being almost knocked to the ground.
On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile,
and he said, in a squeaky voice that made passers-by stare,
Don't be sorry, my dear sir,
for nothing could upset me today.
Rejoice!
For you know who has gone at last.
Even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy, happy day.
And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot.
He had been hugged by a complete stranger.
He also thought he had been called a muggle, whatever that was.
He was rattled.
He hurried to his car and set off for home,
hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before,
because he was a muggle.
He was a muggle.
Because he didn't approve of imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of No. 4,
the first thing he saw, and it didn't improve his mood,
was the tabby cat he'd spo

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:
The sentiment of the text is POSITIVE. The use of words such as "rejoice," "happy," and "celebrating" convey a sense of joy and excitement. The old man's message to Mr Dursley is also positive, urging him to be happy about something having "gone at last." The only negative sentiment in the text is Mr Dursley's confusion and rattled state of mind.

It was now sitting on his garden wall.
He was sure it was the same one.
It had the same markings around its eyes.
Shoo! said Mr Dursley, loudly.
The cat didn't move.
It just gave him a stern look.
Was this normal cat behaviour?
Mr Dursley wondered.
Trying to pull himself together,
he let himself into the house.
He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.
Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day.
She told him over dinner
all about Mrs Nextdoor's problems with her daughter
and how Dudley had learnt a new word.
Won't.
Mr Dursley tried to act normally.
When Dudley had been put to bed,
he went into the living room
in time to catch the last report on the evening news.
And finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported
that the cat had been caught.
The nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today.
Although owls normally hunt at night
and are hardly ever seen in daylight,
there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds
flying in every direction

Experts are unable to explain
why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.
The newscaster allowed himself a grin.
Most mysterious.
And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather.
Going to be any more showers of owls?
Tonight, Jim?
Well, Ted, said the weatherman.
I don't know about that,
but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee
have been phoning in to tell me
that instead of the rain I promised yesterday,
they've had a downpour of shooting stars.
Perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early.
It's not until next week, folks.
But I can promise a wet night tonight.
Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair,
shooting stars all over Britain,
owls flying by daylight,
mysterious people in cloaks all over the place,
and a whisper, a whisper about the potters.
Mrs Dursley came into the living room
carrying two cups of tea.
It was no good.
He'd have to say something to her.

Uh, Petunia, dear,
you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?
No.
As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry.
After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.
No, she said sharply.
Why?
Funny stuff on the news, Mr Dursley mumbled.
Owls shooting stars.
And there are a lot of funny-looking people in town today.
So?
Snapped Mrs Dursley.
Well, I just thought maybe it was something to do with,
you know, her crowd.
Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips.
Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name Potter.
He decided he didn't dare.
Instead, he said as casually as he could,
their son, he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?
I suppose so, said Mrs Dursley stiffly.
What's his name again?
Howard, isn't it?
Harry, nasty common name if you ask me.
Oh, yes, said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.
Yes, I quite agree.
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.

Yes.

there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley.

He yawned and turned over.
It couldn't affect them.
How very wrong he was.

It was sitting as still as a statue,
its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive.
It didn't so much as...
quiver when a car door slammed on the next street,
nor when two owls swooped overhead.
In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
appeared so suddenly and silently,
you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.
The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive.
He was tall, thin, and very old,
judging by the silver of his hair and beard,
which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes,
a purple cloak that swept the ground,
and high-heeled, buckled boots.
His blue eyes were light, bright,
and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles,
and his nose was very long and crooked,
as though it had been broken at least twice.
This man's name was Albus Dumbledo

The sentiment of the text is NEUTRAL. The description of the cat and the man are neutral and factual, without any emotional language or tone. The only hint of emotion is the cat's tail twitching and eyes narrowing, which could be interpreted as a sign of caution or curiosity, but it is not necessarily a positive or negative sentiment.

Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to...
to realise that he'd just arrived in a street
where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.
He was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something,
but he did seem to realise he was being watched
because he looked up suddenly at the cat,
which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.
For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.
He chuckled and muttered,
I should have known.
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
It seemed to be a silver,
a cigarette lighter.
He flicked it open,
held it up in the air,
and clicked it.
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.
He clicked it again.
The next lamp flickered into darkness.
Twelve times he clicked the put-outer,
until the only lights left on the whole street
were two tiny pinpricks in the distance,
which were the eyes of the cat watching him.
If anyone looked out of their window now,
even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley,
they wouldn't be able

The sentiment of the text is positive as Dumbledore is shown to be resourceful and in control, using the cigarette lighter to extinguish the street lamps with a sense of amusement. The cat's watching him with amusement also adds to the positive tone.

Dumbledore slipped the put-outer back inside his cloak
and set off down the street toward number four,
where he sat down on the wall next to the cat.
He didn't look at it,
but after a moment he spoke to it.
Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.
He turned to smile at the tabby,
but it had gone.
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman
who was wearing square glasses
exactly the shape of the mark of a cat.
He was looking at the cat,

            - Dumbledore replies that he has never seen a cat sit so stiffly
            - The woman is sitting on a brick wall

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:
The sentiment of the text is NEUTRAL. The tone is conversational and matter-of-fact, with a hint of curiosity and amusement. The use of phrases like "fancy seeing you here" and "you'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day" suggest a lighthearted and playful tone. However, the text also contains a sense of mystery and intrigue, as Dumbledore seems to be recognizing someone in disguise. Overall, the sentiment is neutral, as the text does not convey a strong emotional tone.

I must have been stiff.
I must have been stiff.

I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
Oh, yes, everyone's celebrating, all right, she said impatiently.
You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no.
Even the muggles have noticed something's going on.
It was on their news.
She jerked her head back at the Dursley's dark living room window.
I heard it.
Flocks of owls, shooting stars.
Well, they're not completely stupid.
They were bound to notice something.
Shooting stars.
Shooting stars.
Shooting stars.
Shooting stars.
Shooting stars.
Shooting stars.
Shooting stars.
Shooting stars.
I'll bet that was Daedalus Diggle.
He never had much sense.
You can't blame them, said Dumbledore gently.
We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.
I know that, said Professor McGo

at last.
The muggles found out about us all.
I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore.
It certainly seems so, said Dumbledore.
We have much to be thankful for.
Would you care for a lemon drop?
A what?
A what?
A lemon drop. They're a kind of muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.
No, thank you, said Professor McGonagall coldly,
as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops.
As I say, even if you-know-who has gone,

For eleven years I've been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name.
Voldemort.
Professor McGonagall flinched,
but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
It all gets so confusing if we keep saying you-know-who.
I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.
I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall,
sounding half-exasperated, half-admiring.
But you're different.
Everyone knows you're the only one you know.
Oh, all right.
Voldemort was frightened of.
You flatter me, said Dumbledore calmly.
Voldemort had powers I will never have.
Only because you're too, well, noble to use them.
It's lucky it's dark.
I haven't blushed so much since Madame Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said,
The owls are nothing.

About what finally stopped him?
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss.
The real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day.
For neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now.
It was plain that whatever everyone was saying,
she was not going to believe it.
Until Dumbledore told her it was true.
Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.
What they're saying, she pressed on,
is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow.
He went to find the Potters.
The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are, are, that they're dead.
Dumbledore bowed his head.
Professor McGonagall gasped.
Lily and James?
I can't believe it.
I didn't want to believe it.
Oh, Albus.
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder.

I know, he said heavily.

That's not all.
They're saying he tried to kill the Potters' son, Harry.
But he couldn't.
He couldn't kill that little boy.
No one knows why.
Or how.
But they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter,
Voldemort's power somehow broke.
And that's why he's gone.
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
It's, it's true, faltered Professor McGonagall.
After all he's done, all the people he's killed, he couldn't kill a little boy.
It's just astounding of all the things to stop him.
But how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?
We can only guess, said Dumbledore.
We may never know.
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it.
It was a very odd watch.
It had twelve hands but no numbers.
Instead, little planets were moving around the edge.
It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,
Dumbledore.

Every child in our world will know his name.

It would be enough.
To turn any boy's head.
Famous before he can walk and talk.
Famous for something he won't even remember.
Can't you see how much better off he'll be,
growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said,
Yes, yes, you're right, of course.

She eyed his cloak.
It looked suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.

What was that?
A low, rumbling sound had broken the silence around them.
It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight.
It swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky,
and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.
He looked simply too big to be allowed,
and so wild.
Long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face.
He had hands the size of trash can lids,
and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.
In his vast, muscular arms, he was holding a bundle of blankets.
Hagrid, said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
At last! And where did you get that motorcycle?
Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir.

            * The man is described as being enormous, with hands and feet that are disproportionately large
            * The speaker refers to the man as "Hagrid" and mentions that he is holding a bundle of blankets
            * The speaker asks Hagrid where he got the motorcycle, and Hagrid replies that he borrowed it
            * The speaker's sentiment is likely positive, as they seem to be in awe of Hagrid's size and strength

              POSITIVE SENTIMENT: The speaker's use of language, such as "enormous," "wild," and "borrowed," suggests that they are in awe of Hagrid's size and strength. The speaker's tone is also one of excitement and curiosity, as they ask Hagrid where he got the motorcycle. Overall, the speaker's sentiment towards Hagrid is likely positive.

              NEGATIVE SENTIMENT: The speaker's use of language, such as "careless," could potentially be seen as negative, as it implies that Hagrid is not being careful or thoughtful. However, this sentiment is not strongly conveyed in the passage, and the speaker's overall tone is one of wonder and admiration for Hagrid's size and strength. Therefore, the speaker's sentiment towards Hagrid is likely positive.

Young Sirius Black lent it to me.
I've got him, sir.
No problems, were there?
No, sir.
House was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the muggles started swarming around.
He fell asleep as we was flying over Bristol.
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.
Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.
Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead,
they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
Is that where, whispered Professor McGonagall?
Yes, said Dumbledore.
He'll have that scar forever.
Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?
Even if I could, I wouldn't.
Scars can come in handy.
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground.
Well, give him here, Hagrid.
We'd better get this over with.
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards the Dursley's house.
Could I, could I say goodbye to him, sir?
Asked Hagrid.
He bent his great shaggy head over Harry

whiskery kiss.
Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
Shh, hissed Professor McGonagall.
You'll wake the muggles.
S-sorry, sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it.
But I can't stand it.
Lily and James dead.
And poor little Harry, off to live with muggles.
Yes, yes, it's all very sad.
But get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found, Professor McGonagall whispered,
patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to
the front door.
He laid Harry.
He gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's
blankets, and then came back to the other two.
For a full minute, the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle.
Hagrid's shoulders shook.
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from
Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.
Well, said Dumbledore final

The emotions expressed by Hagrid, Professor McGonagall, and Dumbledore are all negative, with Hagrid and Professor McGonagall openly sobbing and Dumbledore's light twinkling being absent. The overall sentiment of the text is therefore negative.

We may as well go and join the celebration.
Yeah, said Hagrid in a very muffled voice.
I'll be taking Sirius's bike back.
Good night, Professor McGonagall.
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and
kicked the engine into life.
With a roar, it rose into the air and off into the night.
I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall, said Dumbledore.
Nodding to her.
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.
On the corner, he stopped and took out the silver put-outer.
He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps, so that Privet
Drive glowed suddenly orange, and he could make out a tabby cat slinking round the corner
at the other end of the street.
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
Good luck, Harry, he murmured.

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the
inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up.
One small hand closed on the letter beside him, and he slept on, not knowing he was special.
Not knowing he was famous.
Not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened
the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks
being improdded and pinched by his cousin Dudley.
He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country
were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices,
To Harry Potter.
The boy who lived.
