Listening Library presents Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling.

00:29.520 --> 00:35.680
Chapter One The Boy Who Lived

00:35.680 --> 00:40.120
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of No. 4 Privet Drive were proud to say they were perfectly normal,

00:40.120 --> 00:41.120
thank you very much.

00:41.120 --> 00:46.080
They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,

00:46.080 --> 00:49.480
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

00:49.480 --> 00:54.120
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.

00:54.120 --> 00:59.640
He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.

00:59.640 --> 01:04.800
Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came

01:04.800 --> 01:09.120
in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on

01:09.120 --> 01:10.560
the neighbours.

01:10.560 --> 01:15.320
The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley, and in their opinion there was no finer boy

01:15.320 --> 01:17.520
anywhere.

01:17.520 --> 01:22.320
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest

01:22.320 --> 01:25.880
fear was that somebody would discover it.

01:25.880 --> 01:29.840
They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.080
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years.

01:34.080 --> 01:38.280
In fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her

01:38.280 --> 01:43.720
good-for-nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.640
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street.

01:48.640 --> 01:53.160
The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son too, but they had never even seen

01:53.160 --> 01:54.160
him.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.120
This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.520
They didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

02:01.520 --> 02:06.200
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing

02:06.200 --> 02:10.880
about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be

02:10.880 --> 02:13.040
happening all over the country.

02:13.040 --> 02:18.000
Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped

02:18.000 --> 02:22.280
away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

02:22.280 --> 02:26.520
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.

02:26.520 --> 02:31.520
At half-past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the

02:31.520 --> 02:37.080
cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye, but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum

02:37.080 --> 02:39.400
and throwing his cereal at the walls.

02:39.400 --> 02:45.000
Little tyke, ha ha ha, chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.280
He got into his car and backed out of No. 4's drive.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.840
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar,

02:53.840 --> 02:56.480
a cat reading a map.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.640
For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realise what he had seen, and then he jerked his head around

03:01.640 --> 03:03.080
to look again.

03:03.080 --> 03:08.600
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map inside.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.840
What could he have been thinking of?

03:09.840 --> 03:12.760
It must have been a trick of the light.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.640
Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.400
It stared back.

03:17.400 --> 03:21.360
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.720
It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.360
No, no, looking at the sign.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.760
Cats couldn't read maps or signs.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.120
Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind.

03:35.120 --> 03:39.400
As he drove towards town, he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping

03:39.400 --> 03:41.680
to get that day.

03:41.680 --> 03:46.920
But on the edge of the town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.760
As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed

03:50.760 --> 03:56.600
to be a lot of strangely dressed people about, people in cloaks.

03:56.600 --> 04:01.840
Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes, the get-ups you saw on young

04:01.840 --> 04:03.040
people.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.480
He supposed this was some stupid new fashion.

04:05.480 --> 04:10.040
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos

04:10.040 --> 04:12.200
standing quite close by.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.920
They were whispering excitedly together.

04:14.920 --> 04:19.440
Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all.

04:19.440 --> 04:25.760
Why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak?

04:25.760 --> 04:27.920
The nerve of him.

04:27.920 --> 04:32.080
But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt.

04:32.080 --> 04:37.080
These people were obviously collecting for something, yes, that would be it.

04:37.080 --> 04:41.720
The traffic moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived at the Grunnings parking

04:41.720 --> 04:45.840
lot, his mind back on drills.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.960
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor.

04:49.960 --> 04:54.720
If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.

04:54.720 --> 04:59.960
He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
did.

05:00.960 --> 05:06.280
They pointed and gazed, open mouths, as owl after owl sped overhead.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.520
Most of them had never seen an owl, even at night time.

05:09.520 --> 05:14.160
Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal owl-free morning.

05:14.160 --> 05:18.640
He yelled at five different people, he made several important telephone calls, and shouted

05:18.640 --> 05:20.040
a bit more.

05:20.040 --> 05:25.120
He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and

05:25.120 --> 05:29.160
walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.680
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the

05:32.680 --> 05:33.760
bakers.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.920
He eyed them angrily as he passed.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.800
He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy.

05:38.800 --> 05:44.120
This bunch were whispering excitedly too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.

05:44.120 --> 05:48.760
It was on his way back past them, clutching a large donut in a bag, that he caught a few

05:48.760 --> 05:50.480
words of what they were saying.

05:50.480 --> 05:57.160
The potters, that's right, that's what I heard, yes, their son, Harry.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.520
Mr. Dursley stopped dead.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.520
Fear flooded him.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.320
He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought

06:04.320 --> 06:06.240
better of it.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.800
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not

06:09.800 --> 06:14.120
to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number

06:14.120 --> 06:15.360
when he changed his mind.

06:15.360 --> 06:19.320
He put the receiver back down and stroked his moustache, thinking.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.280
No, he was being stupid.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.840
Potter wasn't such an unusual name.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.360
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.

06:29.360 --> 06:32.200
Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.560
He'd never even seen the boy.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.320
It might have been Harvey, or Harold.

06:37.320 --> 06:41.240
There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of

06:41.240 --> 06:42.440
her sister.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.160
He didn't blame her, if he'd had a sister like that.

06:46.160 --> 06:50.700
But all the same, those people in cloaks.

06:50.700 --> 06:54.600
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon, and when he left the

06:54.600 --> 06:58.360
building at five o'clock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone

06:58.360 --> 07:00.200
just outside the door.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.800
Sorry, he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.

07:04.800 --> 07:10.280
It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.800
He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.

07:13.800 --> 07:18.680
On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile, and he said, in a squeaky voice that

07:18.680 --> 07:24.320
made passers-by stare, Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing would upset me today.

07:24.320 --> 07:28.200
Rejoice, for you know who has gone at last.

07:28.200 --> 07:32.320
Some muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy, happy day.

07:32.320 --> 07:37.400
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.280
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.

07:40.280 --> 07:43.760
He had been hugged by a complete stranger.

07:43.760 --> 07:48.080
He also thought he had been called a muggle, whatever that was.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.300
He was rattled.

07:49.300 --> 07:53.520
He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things which he had

07:53.520 --> 07:58.280
never hoped before because he didn't approve of imagination.

07:58.280 --> 08:02.640
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw, and it didn't improve

08:02.640 --> 08:06.240
his mood, was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.800
It was now sitting on his garden wall.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.240
He was sure it was the same one.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.160
It had the same markings around its eyes.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.640
Shoo, said Mr. Dursley loudly.

08:16.640 --> 08:20.200
The cat didn't move, it just gave him a stern look.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.760
Was this normal cat behavior, Mr. Dursley wondered.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.500
Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.880
He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.880
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.280
She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how

08:38.280 --> 08:42.520
Dudley had learnt a new word, won't.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.000
Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.920
When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last

08:48.920 --> 08:51.600
report on the evening news.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.880
And finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been

08:55.880 --> 08:58.560
behaving very unusually today.

08:58.560 --> 09:03.560
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been

09:03.560 --> 09:08.760
hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.

09:08.760 --> 09:14.200
Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.360
The newscaster allowed himself a grin.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.640
Mysterious.

09:18.640 --> 09:22.400
And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.840
Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?

09:25.840 --> 09:31.200
Well, Ted, said the weatherman, I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that

09:31.200 --> 09:32.960
have been acting oddly today.

09:32.960 --> 09:38.000
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that

09:38.000 --> 09:44.600
instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.960
Those people have been celebrating bonfire night early.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.600
It's not until next week, folks.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.480
But I can promise a wet night tonight.

09:54.480 --> 10:01.480
Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair, shooting stars all over Britain, owls flying by daylight,

10:01.480 --> 10:08.280
mysterious people in cloaks all over the place, and a whisper, a whisper about the potters.

10:08.280 --> 10:12.280
Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.280
It was no good.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.960
He'd have to say something to her.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.720
He cleared his throat nervously.

10:16.720 --> 10:22.720
Petunia, dear, you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?

10:22.720 --> 10:26.040
As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.240
After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.360
No, she said sharply.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.360
Why?

10:32.360 --> 10:39.160
Funny stuff on the news, Mr Dursley mumbled, owls, shooting stars, and there are a lot

10:39.160 --> 10:42.280
of funny-looking people in town today.

10:42.280 --> 10:50.520
So, snapped Mrs Dursley, well, I just thought maybe it was something to do with, you know,

10:50.520 --> 10:52.760
her crowd.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.240
Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips.

10:56.240 --> 11:00.680
Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name potter.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.840
He decided he didn't dare.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.960
Instead, he said as casual as he could, their son.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.640
He'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?

11:10.640 --> 11:14.440
I suppose so, said Mrs Dursley stiffly.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.680
What's his name again?

11:16.680 --> 11:18.520
Howard, isn't it?

11:18.520 --> 11:22.000
Harry, nasty common name, if you ask me.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.080
Oh, yes, said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly, yes, I quite agree.

11:29.080 --> 11:33.040
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.

11:33.040 --> 11:37.520
While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered

11:37.520 --> 11:39.720
down into the front garden.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.360
The cat was still there.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.880
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.080
Was he imagining things?

11:48.080 --> 11:51.400
Could all this have anything to do with the potters?

11:51.400 --> 11:57.000
If it did, if it got out that they were related to a pair of, well, he didn't think he could

11:57.000 --> 11:58.920
bear it.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.440
Mr Dursley's got into bed.

12:00.440 --> 12:05.920
Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly, but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.

12:05.920 --> 12:11.280
His last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved,

12:11.280 --> 12:15.400
there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley.

12:15.400 --> 12:20.600
The potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.

12:20.600 --> 12:25.080
He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.680
He yawned and turned over.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.640
It couldn't affect them.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.480
How very wrong he was.

12:34.480 --> 12:39.880
Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside

12:39.880 --> 12:42.840
was showing no sign of sleepiness.

12:42.840 --> 12:49.120
It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet

12:49.120 --> 12:50.440
Drive.

12:50.440 --> 12:54.800
It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls

12:54.800 --> 12:56.400
swooped overhead.

12:56.400 --> 13:02.000
In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.560
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently

13:07.560 --> 13:10.360
you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.520
The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

13:14.520 --> 13:18.120
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive.

13:18.120 --> 13:24.240
He was tall, thin, and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were

13:24.240 --> 13:26.960
both long enough to tuck into his belt.

13:26.960 --> 13:32.800
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled

13:32.800 --> 13:33.800
boots.

13:33.800 --> 13:39.200
His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles, and his nose

13:39.200 --> 13:44.000
was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.040
This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.

13:49.040 --> 13:54.080
Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realise that he'd just arrived in a street where everything

13:54.080 --> 13:57.320
from his name to his boots was unwelcome.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.520
He was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something, but he did seem to realise

14:01.520 --> 14:05.880
he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring

14:05.880 --> 14:07.600
at him from the other end of the street.

14:07.600 --> 14:11.280
For some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.

14:11.280 --> 14:16.560
He chuckled and muttered, I should have known.

14:16.560 --> 14:19.640
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.360
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter.

14:22.360 --> 14:25.680
He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.

14:25.680 --> 14:29.080
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.200
He clicked it again.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.320
The next lamp flickered into darkness.

14:32.320 --> 14:37.440
Twelve times he clicked the put outer until the only lights left on the whole street were

14:37.440 --> 14:42.920
two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him.

14:42.920 --> 14:47.640
If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't

14:47.640 --> 14:52.280
be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.

14:52.280 --> 14:56.560
The door slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward

14:56.560 --> 15:01.120
number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat.

15:01.120 --> 15:05.120
He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.

15:05.120 --> 15:10.600
Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.

15:10.600 --> 15:14.360
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.

15:14.360 --> 15:19.720
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly

15:19.720 --> 15:23.500
the shape of the markings the cat had had round its eyes.

15:23.500 --> 15:27.020
She too was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.

15:27.020 --> 15:29.640
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.320
She looked distinctly ruffled.

15:32.320 --> 15:35.800
How did you know it was me? she asked.

15:35.800 --> 15:41.320
My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.

15:41.320 --> 15:46.640
You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day, said Professor McGonagall.

15:46.640 --> 15:52.920
All day, when you could have been celebrating, I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties

15:52.920 --> 15:55.160
on my way here.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.800
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

15:56.800 --> 16:01.160
Oh, yes, everyone's celebrating, all right, she said impatiently.

16:01.160 --> 16:05.880
You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no, even the muggles have noticed something's

16:05.880 --> 16:06.880
going on.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.600
It was on their news.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.480
She jerked her head back at the Dursley's dark living room window.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.480
I heard it.

16:12.480 --> 16:16.680
Flocks of owls, shooting stars, well, they're not completely stupid.

16:16.680 --> 16:21.360
They were bound to notice something, shooting stars down in Kent.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.800
I'll bet that was Deedless Diggle.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.220
He never had much sense.

16:26.220 --> 16:29.440
You can't blame them, said Dumbledore gently.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.720
We've had precious little to celebrate for 11 years.

16:33.720 --> 16:40.320
I know that, said Professor McGonagall irritably, but that's no reason to lose our heads.

16:40.320 --> 16:45.400
People are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed

16:45.400 --> 16:48.960
in muggle clothes, swapping rumours.

16:48.960 --> 16:53.920
She threw a sharp sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell

16:53.920 --> 16:56.160
her something, but he didn't.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.160
So she went on.

16:57.160 --> 17:02.480
A fine thing it would be if, on the very day you-know-who seems to have disappeared at

17:02.480 --> 17:05.800
last, the muggles found out about us all.

17:05.800 --> 17:10.560
I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.600
It certainly seems so, said Dumbledore.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.800
We have much to be thankful for.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.040
Would you care for a lemon drop?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.440
A what?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.200
A lemon drop.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.440
They're a kind of muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.

17:26.440 --> 17:31.440
No thank you, said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment

17:31.440 --> 17:32.440
for lemon drops.

17:32.720 --> 17:40.200
As I say, even if you-know-who has gone, my dear Professor, surely a sensible person like

17:40.200 --> 17:43.480
yourself can call him by his name?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.960
All this you-know-who nonsense.

17:45.960 --> 17:52.800
For eleven years I've been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name, Voldemort.

17:52.800 --> 17:57.840
Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed

17:57.840 --> 17:59.160
not to notice.

17:59.160 --> 18:03.440
It all gets so confusing if we keep saying you-know-who.

18:03.440 --> 18:08.320
I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.

18:08.320 --> 18:14.720
I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half-exasperated, half-admiring.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.520
But you're different.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.520
Everyone knows you're the only one you know.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.120
Oh, all right.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.600
Voldemort was frightened of.

18:24.600 --> 18:28.080
You flatter me, said Dumbledore calmly.

18:28.080 --> 18:37.320
Voldemort had powers I will never have, only because you're too, well, noble to use them.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.880
It's lucky it's dark.

18:38.880 --> 18:46.280
I haven't blushed so much since Madame Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.440
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said,

18:49.440 --> 18:52.560
The owls are nothing next to the rumours that are flying around.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.720
You know what everyone's saying?

18:54.720 --> 18:56.800
About why he's disappeared?

18:56.840 --> 19:00.400
About what finally stopped him?

19:00.400 --> 19:05.080
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss.

19:05.080 --> 19:09.880
The real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a

19:09.880 --> 19:15.680
cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now.

19:15.680 --> 19:21.520
It was plain that whatever everyone was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore

19:21.520 --> 19:23.480
told her it was true.

19:23.520 --> 19:28.800
Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.

19:28.800 --> 19:36.280
What they're saying, she pressed on, is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's hollow.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.400
He went to find the Potters.

19:38.400 --> 19:46.680
The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are, are, that they're dead.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.840
Dumbledore bowed his head.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.640
Professor McGonagall gasped.

19:50.640 --> 19:54.280
Lily and James, I can't believe it.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.280
I didn't want to believe it.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.760
Oh, Albus.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.520
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder.

20:01.520 --> 20:06.200
I know, I know, he said heavily.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.360
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.680
That's not all.

20:10.680 --> 20:16.480
They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry, but he couldn't.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.120
He couldn't kill that little boy.

20:19.160 --> 20:24.440
No one knows why or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter,

20:24.440 --> 20:30.720
Voldemort's power somehow broke and that's why he's gone.

20:30.720 --> 20:33.040
Dumbledore nodded glumly.

20:33.040 --> 20:37.200
It's, it's true, faltered Professor McGonagall.

20:37.200 --> 20:43.280
After all he's done, all the people he's killed, he couldn't kill a little boy.

20:43.280 --> 20:47.040
It's just astounding of all the things to stop him.

20:47.040 --> 20:51.680
But how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?

20:51.680 --> 20:57.280
We can only guess, said Dumbledore, we may never know.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.920
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and

20:59.920 --> 21:02.720
dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.720
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and

21:06.720 --> 21:08.080
examined it.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.800
It was a very odd watch.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.560
It had 12 hands but no numbers.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.920
Instead, little planets were moving around the edge.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.800
It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though,

21:17.800 --> 21:22.080
because he put it back in his pocket and said, Hagrid's late.

21:22.080 --> 21:26.520
I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.760
Yes, said Professor McGonagall, and

21:28.760 --> 21:34.120
I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here of all places.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.520
I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.

21:37.520 --> 21:40.960
They're the only family he has left now.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.560
You don't mean, you can't mean the people who live here,

21:44.560 --> 21:48.320
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.440
Dumbledore, you can't.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.560
I've been watching them all day.

21:52.560 --> 21:57.480
You couldn't find two people who are less like us, and they've got this son.

21:57.480 --> 22:02.880
I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.960
Harry Potter, come and live here.

22:05.960 --> 22:09.760
It's the best place for him, said Dumbledore firmly.

22:09.760 --> 22:14.280
His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.360
I've written them a letter.

22:16.360 --> 22:21.400
A letter, repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall.

22:21.400 --> 22:25.360
Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?

22:25.360 --> 22:28.080
These people will never understand him.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.840
He'll be famous, a legend.

22:30.840 --> 22:35.480
I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.960
There will be books written about Harry.

22:37.960 --> 22:42.040
Every child in our world will know his name.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.360
Exactly, said Dumbledore,

22:44.360 --> 22:48.280
looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.800
It would be enough to turn any boy's head.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.960
Famous before he can walk and talk.

22:54.960 --> 22:58.560
Famous for something he won't even remember.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.480
Can't you see how much better off he'll be,

23:01.480 --> 23:05.080
growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?

23:06.160 --> 23:10.240
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and

23:10.240 --> 23:14.600
then said, yes, yes, you're right, of course.

23:14.600 --> 23:18.440
But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?

23:18.440 --> 23:19.360
She eyed his cloak,

23:19.360 --> 23:23.200
suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.800
Hagrid's bringing him.

23:25.800 --> 23:31.440
You think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?

23:31.440 --> 23:35.720
I would trust Hagrid with my life, said Dumbledore.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.440
I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,

23:38.480 --> 23:40.480
said Professor McGonagall grudgingly.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.160
But you can't pretend he's not careless.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.280
He does tend to, what was that?

23:46.280 --> 23:49.320
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.400
It grew steadily louder as they looked up and

23:51.400 --> 23:53.960
down the street for some sign of a headlight.

23:53.960 --> 23:57.360
It swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.760
And a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and

24:00.760 --> 24:02.120
landed on the road in front of them.

24:03.360 --> 24:08.040
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.

24:08.800 --> 24:15.000
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man, and at least five times as wide.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.560
He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.360
Long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.600
He had hands the size of trash can lids, and

24:27.600 --> 24:31.760
his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.

24:31.760 --> 24:35.960
In his vast muscular arms, he was holding a bundle of blankets.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.160
Hagrid, said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.

24:40.160 --> 24:45.360
At last, and where did you get that motorcycle?

24:45.360 --> 24:48.920
Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir, said the giant,

24:48.920 --> 24:51.800
climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.400
Young Sirius Black lent it to me.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.200
I've got him, sir.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.040
No problems, were there?

24:58.040 --> 25:00.880
No, sir, house was almost destroyed, but

25:00.880 --> 25:05.400
I got him out all right before the muggles started swarming around.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.320
He fell asleep as we was flying over Bristol.

25:09.680 --> 25:13.880
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.

25:13.880 --> 25:18.160
Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.

25:18.160 --> 25:21.080
Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead,

25:21.080 --> 25:25.760
they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.840
Is that where, whispered Professor McGonagall.

25:28.840 --> 25:33.160
Yes, said Dumbledore, he'll have that scar forever.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.360
Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?

25:37.360 --> 25:39.960
Even if I could, I wouldn't.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.200
Scars can come in handy.

25:42.200 --> 25:48.400
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.640
Well, give him here, Hagrid.

25:50.640 --> 25:53.520
We'd better get this over with.

25:53.520 --> 25:57.880
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards the Dursley's house.

25:57.880 --> 26:01.760
Could I say goodbye to him, sir?

26:01.960 --> 26:03.360
Asked Hagrid.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.040
He bent his great shaggy head over Harry and

26:06.040 --> 26:10.000
gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.520
Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.040
Shh, hissed Professor McGonagall.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.280
You'll wake the muggles.

26:18.280 --> 26:22.760
Sorry, sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted handkerchief and

26:22.760 --> 26:24.520
burying his face in it.

26:24.520 --> 26:29.280
But I can't stand it, Lily and James dead.

26:29.280 --> 26:33.120
And poor little Harry, off to live with muggles.

26:33.120 --> 26:38.640
Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.400
Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as

26:42.400 --> 26:46.960
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.920
He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak,

26:50.920 --> 26:55.160
tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two.

26:55.160 --> 26:59.440
For a full minute, the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.320
Hagrid's shoulders shook.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.120
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously.

27:04.120 --> 27:07.920
And the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes

27:07.920 --> 27:09.840
seemed to have gone out.

27:09.840 --> 27:13.520
Well, said Dumbledore finally, that's that.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.520
We've no business staying here.

27:15.520 --> 27:19.120
We may as well go and join the celebrations.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.160
Yeah, said Hagrid in a very muffled voice.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.040
I'll be taking Sirius's bite back.

27:25.920 --> 27:29.760
Good night, Professor McGonagall, Professor Dumbledore, sir.

27:29.760 --> 27:34.080
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto

27:34.080 --> 27:37.000
the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.240
With a roar, it rose into the air and off into the night.

27:41.360 --> 27:46.480
I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall, said Dumbledore,

27:46.480 --> 27:47.760
nodding to her.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.160
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.

27:51.280 --> 27:54.080
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.480
On the corner, he stopped and took out the silver put-outer.

27:57.480 --> 28:02.120
He clicked it once, and 12 balls of light sped back to their street lamps, so

28:02.120 --> 28:06.680
that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange, and he could make out a tabby cat slinking

28:06.680 --> 28:09.200
around the corner at the other end of the street.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.720
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.

28:13.800 --> 28:17.480
Good luck, Harry, he murmured.

28:17.480 --> 28:21.600
He turned on his heel, and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.

28:21.600 --> 28:26.280
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive,

28:26.280 --> 28:29.960
which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.800
The very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.

28:34.880 --> 28:39.560
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up.

28:39.560 --> 28:44.480
One small hand closed on the letter beside him, and he slept on,

28:44.480 --> 28:49.360
not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous,

28:49.400 --> 28:53.200
not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.

28:53.200 --> 28:57.960
Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor

28:57.960 --> 29:04.080
that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley.

29:04.080 --> 29:08.600
He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over

29:08.600 --> 29:14.640
the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices,

29:14.640 --> 29:18.000
to Harry Potter, the boy who lived.
