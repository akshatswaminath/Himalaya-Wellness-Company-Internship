00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,680
Chapter One The Boy Who Lived

3
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,120
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of No. 4 Privet Drive were proud to say they were perfectly normal,

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
thank you very much.

5
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,080
They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,480
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

7
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,120
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,640
He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,800
Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,120
in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,560
the neighbours.

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,320
The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley, and in their opinion there was no finer boy

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,520
anywhere.

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,880
fear was that somebody would discover it.

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,840
They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,080
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years.

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,280
In fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,720
good-for-nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be.

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,640
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street.

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,160
The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son too, but they had never even seen

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
him.

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,120
This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away.

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,520
They didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,200
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,880
about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,040
happening all over the country.

28
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,000
Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,280
away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,520
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,520
At half-past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,080
cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye, but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,400
and throwing his cereal at the walls.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,000
Little tyke, ha ha ha, chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,280
He got into his car and backed out of No. 4's drive.

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,840
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar,

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,480
a cat reading a map.

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,640
For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realise what he had seen, and then he jerked his head around

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,080
to look again.

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,600
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map inside.

41
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,840
What could he have been thinking of?

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,760
It must have been a trick of the light.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,640
Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.

44
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,400
It stared back.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,360
As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive.

47
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,360
No, no, looking at the sign.

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,760
Cats couldn't read maps or signs.

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,120
Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind.

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,400
As he drove towards town, he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping

51
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,680
to get that day.

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,920
But on the edge of the town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else.

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,760
As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed

54
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,600
to be a lot of strangely dressed people about, people in cloaks.

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,840
Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes, the get-ups you saw on young

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,040
people.

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,480
He supposed this was some stupid new fashion.

58
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,040
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,200
standing quite close by.

60
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,920
They were whispering excitedly together.

61
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,440
Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all.

62
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,760
Why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak?

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,920
The nerve of him.

64
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,080
But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt.

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,080
These people were obviously collecting for something, yes, that would be it.

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,720
The traffic moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived at the Grunnings parking

67
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,840
lot, his mind back on drills.

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,960
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor.

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,720
If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.

70
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,960
He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street

71
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
did.

72
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,280
They pointed and gazed, open mouths, as owl after owl sped overhead.

73
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,520
Most of them had never seen an owl, even at night time.

74
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,160
Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal owl-free morning.

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,640
He yelled at five different people, he made several important telephone calls, and shouted

76
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
a bit more.

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,120
He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and

78
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,160
walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,680
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the

80
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,760
bakers.

81
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,920
He eyed them angrily as he passed.

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,800
He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy.

83
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,120
This bunch were whispering excitedly too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.

84
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,760
It was on his way back past them, clutching a large donut in a bag, that he caught a few

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,480
words of what they were saying.

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,160
The potters, that's right, that's what I heard, yes, their son, Harry.

87
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,520
Mr. Dursley stopped dead.

88
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Fear flooded him.

89
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,320
He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought

90
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,240
better of it.

91
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,800
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not

92
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,120
to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number

93
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,360
when he changed his mind.

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,320
He put the receiver back down and stroked his moustache, thinking.

95
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,280
No, he was being stupid.

96
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,840
Potter wasn't such an unusual name.

97
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,360
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.

98
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,200
Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry.

99
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,560
He'd never even seen the boy.

100
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,320
It might have been Harvey, or Harold.

101
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,240
There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley, she always got so upset at any mention of

102
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,440
her sister.

103
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,160
He didn't blame her, if he'd had a sister like that.

104
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,700
But all the same, those people in cloaks.

105
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,600
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon, and when he left the

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,360
building at five o'clock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone

107
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,200
just outside the door.

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,800
Sorry, he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,280
It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak.

110
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,800
He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,680
On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile, and he said, in a squeaky voice that

112
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,320
made passers-by stare, Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing would upset me today.

113
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,200
Rejoice, for you know who has gone at last.

114
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,320
Some muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy, happy day.

115
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,400
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.

116
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,280
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.

117
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,760
He had been hugged by a complete stranger.

118
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,080
He also thought he had been called a muggle, whatever that was.

119
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,300
He was rattled.

120
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,520
He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things which he had

121
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,280
never hoped before because he didn't approve of imagination.

122
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,640
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw, and it didn't improve

123
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,240
his mood, was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning.

124
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
It was now sitting on his garden wall.

125
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
He was sure it was the same one.

126
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,160
It had the same markings around its eyes.

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,640
Shoo, said Mr. Dursley loudly.

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,200
The cat didn't move, it just gave him a stern look.

129
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,760
Was this normal cat behavior, Mr. Dursley wondered.

130
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,500
Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house.

131
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,880
He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.

132
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day.

133
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,280
She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how

134
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,520
Dudley had learnt a new word, won't.

135
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,000
Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,920
When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last

137
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,600
report on the evening news.

138
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,880
And finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been

139
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,560
behaving very unusually today.

140
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been

141
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,760
hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.

142
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,200
Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.

143
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,360
The newscaster allowed himself a grin.

144
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Mysterious.

145
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,400
And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather.

146
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,840
Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?

147
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,200
Well, Ted, said the weatherman, I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that

148
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,960
have been acting oddly today.

149
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,000
Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,600
instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars.

151
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,960
Those people have been celebrating bonfire night early.

152
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,600
It's not until next week, folks.

153
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,480
But I can promise a wet night tonight.

154
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair, shooting stars all over Britain, owls flying by daylight,

155
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:08,280
mysterious people in cloaks all over the place, and a whisper, a whisper about the potters.

156
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.

157
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
It was no good.

158
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,960
He'd have to say something to her.

159
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,720
He cleared his throat nervously.

160
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Petunia, dear, you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?

161
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,040
As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry.

162
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,240
After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.

163
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,360
No, she said sharply.

164
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Why?

165
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:39,160
Funny stuff on the news, Mr Dursley mumbled, owls, shooting stars, and there are a lot

166
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,280
of funny-looking people in town today.

167
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:50,520
So, snapped Mrs Dursley, well, I just thought maybe it was something to do with, you know,

168
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,760
her crowd.

169
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,240
Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips.

170
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,680
Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name potter.

171
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,840
He decided he didn't dare.

172
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,960
Instead, he said as casual as he could, their son.

173
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,640
He'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?

174
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,440
I suppose so, said Mrs Dursley stiffly.

175
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,680
What's his name again?

176
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,520
Howard, isn't it?

177
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,000
Harry, nasty common name, if you ask me.

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,080
Oh, yes, said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly, yes, I quite agree.

179
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,040
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.

180
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,520
While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered

181
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,720
down into the front garden.

182
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,360
The cat was still there.

183
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,880
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.

184
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,080
Was he imagining things?

185
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,400
Could all this have anything to do with the potters?

186
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,000
If it did, if it got out that they were related to a pair of, well, he didn't think he could

187
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,920
bear it.

188
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,440
Mr Dursley's got into bed.

189
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,920
Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly, but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.

190
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,280
His last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved,

191
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,400
there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley.

192
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,600
The potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.

193
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,080
He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on.

194
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,680
He yawned and turned over.

195
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,640
It couldn't affect them.

196
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,480
How very wrong he was.

197
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,880
Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside

198
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,840
was showing no sign of sleepiness.

199
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,120
It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet

200
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,440
Drive.

201
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,800
It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls

202
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,400
swooped overhead.

203
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,000
In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,560
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently

205
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,360
you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.

206
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,520
The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

207
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,120
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive.

208
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,240
He was tall, thin, and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were

209
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,960
both long enough to tuck into his belt.

210
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,800
He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled

211
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
boots.

212
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,200
His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles, and his nose

213
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,000
was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice.

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,040
This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.

215
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,080
Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realise that he'd just arrived in a street where everything

216
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,320
from his name to his boots was unwelcome.

217
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,520
He was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something, but he did seem to realise

218
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,880
he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring

219
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,600
at him from the other end of the street.

220
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,280
For some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.

221
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,560
He chuckled and muttered, I should have known.

222
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,640
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.

223
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,360
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter.

224
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,680
He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.

225
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,080
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.

226
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,200
He clicked it again.

227
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,320
The next lamp flickered into darkness.

228
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,440
Twelve times he clicked the put outer until the only lights left on the whole street were

229
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,920
two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him.

230
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,640
If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't

231
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,280
be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.

232
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,560
The door slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward

233
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,120
number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat.

234
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.

235
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,600
Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.

236
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,360
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.

237
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,720
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly

238
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,500
the shape of the markings the cat had had round its eyes.

239
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,020
She too was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.

240
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,640
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun.

241
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,320
She looked distinctly ruffled.

242
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,800
How did you know it was me? she asked.

243
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,320
My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.

244
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,640
You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day, said Professor McGonagall.

245
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,920
All day, when you could have been celebrating, I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties

246
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,160
on my way here.

247
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,800
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

248
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,160
Oh, yes, everyone's celebrating, all right, she said impatiently.

249
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,880
You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no, even the muggles have noticed something's

250
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
going on.

251
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,600
It was on their news.

252
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,480
She jerked her head back at the Dursley's dark living room window.

253
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
I heard it.

254
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,680
Flocks of owls, shooting stars, well, they're not completely stupid.

255
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,360
They were bound to notice something, shooting stars down in Kent.

256
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,800
I'll bet that was Deedless Diggle.

257
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,220
He never had much sense.

258
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,440
You can't blame them, said Dumbledore gently.

259
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,720
We've had precious little to celebrate for 11 years.

260
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,320
I know that, said Professor McGonagall irritably, but that's no reason to lose our heads.

261
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,400
People are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed

262
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,960
in muggle clothes, swapping rumours.

263
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,920
She threw a sharp sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell

264
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,160
her something, but he didn't.

265
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
So she went on.

266
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,480
A fine thing it would be if, on the very day you-know-who seems to have disappeared at

267
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,800
last, the muggles found out about us all.

268
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,560
I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore.

269
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,600
It certainly seems so, said Dumbledore.

270
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,800
We have much to be thankful for.

271
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,040
Would you care for a lemon drop?

272
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,440
A what?

273
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,200
A lemon drop.

274
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,440
They're a kind of muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.

275
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,440
No thank you, said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment

276
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
for lemon drops.

277
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,200
As I say, even if you-know-who has gone, my dear Professor, surely a sensible person like

278
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,480
yourself can call him by his name?

279
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,960
All this you-know-who nonsense.

280
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,800
For eleven years I've been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name, Voldemort.

281
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,840
Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed

282
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,160
not to notice.

283
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,440
It all gets so confusing if we keep saying you-know-who.

284
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,320
I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.

285
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,720
I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half-exasperated, half-admiring.

286
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,520
But you're different.

287
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Everyone knows you're the only one you know.

288
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,120
Oh, all right.

289
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,600
Voldemort was frightened of.

290
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,080
You flatter me, said Dumbledore calmly.

291
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:37,320
Voldemort had powers I will never have, only because you're too, well, noble to use them.

292
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,880
It's lucky it's dark.

293
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:46,280
I haven't blushed so much since Madame Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.

294
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,440
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said,

295
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,560
The owls are nothing next to the rumours that are flying around.

296
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,720
You know what everyone's saying?

297
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,800
About why he's disappeared?

298
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,400
About what finally stopped him?

299
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,080
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss.

300
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,880
The real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a

301
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,680
cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now.

302
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,520
It was plain that whatever everyone was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore

303
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,480
told her it was true.

304
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,800
Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.

305
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:36,280
What they're saying, she pressed on, is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's hollow.

306
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,400
He went to find the Potters.

307
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:46,680
The rumour is that Lily and James Potter are, are, that they're dead.

308
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,840
Dumbledore bowed his head.

309
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,640
Professor McGonagall gasped.

310
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,280
Lily and James, I can't believe it.

311
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
I didn't want to believe it.

312
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,760
Oh, Albus.

313
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,520
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder.

314
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,200
I know, I know, he said heavily.

315
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,360
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on.

316
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,680
That's not all.

317
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,480
They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry, but he couldn't.

318
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,120
He couldn't kill that little boy.

319
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,440
No one knows why or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter,

320
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,720
Voldemort's power somehow broke and that's why he's gone.

321
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,040
Dumbledore nodded glumly.

322
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,200
It's, it's true, faltered Professor McGonagall.

323
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,280
After all he's done, all the people he's killed, he couldn't kill a little boy.

324
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,040
It's just astounding of all the things to stop him.

325
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,680
But how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?

326
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,280
We can only guess, said Dumbledore, we may never know.

327
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,920
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and

328
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,720
dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.

329
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and

330
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,080
examined it.

331
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,800
It was a very odd watch.

332
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,560
It had 12 hands but no numbers.

333
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,920
Instead, little planets were moving around the edge.

334
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,800
It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though,

335
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,080
because he put it back in his pocket and said, Hagrid's late.

336
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,520
I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way.

337
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,760
Yes, said Professor McGonagall, and

338
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,120
I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here of all places.

339
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,520
I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.

340
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,960
They're the only family he has left now.

341
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,560
You don't mean, you can't mean the people who live here,

342
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,320
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.

343
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,440
Dumbledore, you can't.

344
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,560
I've been watching them all day.

345
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,480
You couldn't find two people who are less like us, and they've got this son.

346
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,880
I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.

347
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,960
Harry Potter, come and live here.

348
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,760
It's the best place for him, said Dumbledore firmly.

349
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,280
His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older.

350
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,360
I've written them a letter.

351
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,400
A letter, repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall.

352
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,360
Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?

353
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,080
These people will never understand him.

354
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,840
He'll be famous, a legend.

355
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,480
I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future.

356
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,960
There will be books written about Harry.

357
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,040
Every child in our world will know his name.

358
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,360
Exactly, said Dumbledore,

359
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,280
looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.

360
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,800
It would be enough to turn any boy's head.

361
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,960
Famous before he can walk and talk.

362
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,560
Famous for something he won't even remember.

363
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,480
Can't you see how much better off he'll be,

364
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,080
growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?

365
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,240
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and

366
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,600
then said, yes, yes, you're right, of course.

367
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,440
But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?

368
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,360
She eyed his cloak,

369
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,200
suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.

370
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,800
Hagrid's bringing him.

371
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,440
You think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?

372
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,720
I would trust Hagrid with my life, said Dumbledore.

373
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,440
I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,

374
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
said Professor McGonagall grudgingly.

375
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,160
But you can't pretend he's not careless.

376
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,280
He does tend to, what was that?

377
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,320
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them.

378
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,400
It grew steadily louder as they looked up and

379
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,960
down the street for some sign of a headlight.

380
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,360
It swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky.

381
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,760
And a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and

382
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,120
landed on the road in front of them.

383
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,040
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.

384
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,000
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man, and at least five times as wide.

385
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,560
He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild.

386
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,360
Long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face.

387
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,600
He had hands the size of trash can lids, and

388
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,760
his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.

389
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,960
In his vast muscular arms, he was holding a bundle of blankets.

390
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,160
Hagrid, said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.

391
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,360
At last, and where did you get that motorcycle?

392
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,920
Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir, said the giant,

393
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,800
climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke.

394
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,400
Young Sirius Black lent it to me.

395
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,200
I've got him, sir.

396
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,040
No problems, were there?

397
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,880
No, sir, house was almost destroyed, but

398
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,400
I got him out all right before the muggles started swarming around.

399
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,320
He fell asleep as we was flying over Bristol.

400
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,880
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.

401
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,160
Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.

402
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,080
Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead,

403
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,760
they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.

404
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,840
Is that where, whispered Professor McGonagall.

405
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,160
Yes, said Dumbledore, he'll have that scar forever.

406
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,360
Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?

407
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,960
Even if I could, I wouldn't.

408
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,200
Scars can come in handy.

409
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,400
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground.

410
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,640
Well, give him here, Hagrid.

411
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,520
We'd better get this over with.

412
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,880
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards the Dursley's house.

413
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,760
Could I say goodbye to him, sir?

414
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,360
Asked Hagrid.

415
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,040
He bent his great shaggy head over Harry and

416
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,000
gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.

417
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,520
Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.

418
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,040
Shh, hissed Professor McGonagall.

419
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,280
You'll wake the muggles.

420
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,760
Sorry, sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted handkerchief and

421
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,520
burying his face in it.

422
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,280
But I can't stand it, Lily and James dead.

423
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,120
And poor little Harry, off to live with muggles.

424
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,640
Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found.

425
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,400
Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as

426
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,960
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.

427
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,920
He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak,

428
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,160
tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two.

429
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,440
For a full minute, the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle.

430
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,320
Hagrid's shoulders shook.

431
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,120
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously.

432
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,920
And the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes

433
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,840
seemed to have gone out.

434
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,520
Well, said Dumbledore finally, that's that.

435
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
We've no business staying here.

436
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,120
We may as well go and join the celebrations.

437
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,160
Yeah, said Hagrid in a very muffled voice.

438
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,040
I'll be taking Sirius's bite back.

439
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,760
Good night, Professor McGonagall, Professor Dumbledore, sir.

440
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,080
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto

441
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,000
the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life.

442
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,240
With a roar, it rose into the air and off into the night.

443
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,480
I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall, said Dumbledore,

444
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,760
nodding to her.

445
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,160
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.

446
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,080
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.

447
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,480
On the corner, he stopped and took out the silver put-outer.

448
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,120
He clicked it once, and 12 balls of light sped back to their street lamps, so

449
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,680
that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange, and he could make out a tabby cat slinking

450
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,200
around the corner at the other end of the street.

451
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,720
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.

452
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,480
Good luck, Harry, he murmured.

453
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,600
He turned on his heel, and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.

454
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,280
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive,

455
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,960
which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky.

456
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,800
The very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.

457
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,560
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up.

458
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,480
One small hand closed on the letter beside him, and he slept on,

459
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,360
not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous,

460
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,200
not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.

461
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,960
Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor

462
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,080
that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley.

463
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,600
He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over

464
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,640
the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices,

465
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,000
to Harry Potter, the boy who lived.
